InSTAnT
=========

**InSTAnT** is a toolkit to idetify gene pairs which are d-colocalized
from single molecule measurement data e.g. MERFISH or SeqFISH. A gene
pair is d-colocalized when their transcripts are within distance d
across many cells.

This repository contains implementation of PP Test and CPB test and demo
on a U2OS dataset. The dataset can be downloaded from here (Moffit et
al., 2016, PNAS ) -

First we’ll load data. We’ll use Replicate 3 for our demo purpose.
